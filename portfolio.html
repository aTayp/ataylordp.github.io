            <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                I'm from Brazil but I've been in Canada for 3 years now. Since I was a kid I like technology and the english language. That combination helped me understand my country was behind in many aspects and that I wanted to learn what was happening outside. Games, programming, movies, music and my mother, who works at international banks, helped me be a fluent speaker.
                When I could access a computer outside school I started playing games and found my first tech passion. I started learning how they work and decided to make my own game servers from the games GunZ: The Duel and MapleStory. I learned the whole structure of both, from SQL to Java, C#, C++, PHP, HTML and more like reverse engineering.
                I had life full of different experiences because I decided to travel to find out more. I've been in USA, Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paris and United Kingdom. Finally I decided to stablish a life in Canada and follow my dream paths to become a proper professional. Nowadays all my focus is on IT, specifically Data Analysis and Cybersecurity.
                Only the cybersecurity I am learning 100% new stuff from areas like hardware hacking.
